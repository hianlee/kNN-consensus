# kNN Consensus
This repo contains the code for simulating and performing analysis of a swarm of decentralised agents carrying out a consensus task. The environment is a square grid with individual cells taking on the value of `1` or `0`. Agents attempt to determine the true state of the environment in the presence of noise and limited levels of communication.
